      In the nineties and noughties, net art, i.e. art with Internet technologies, was in its heyday. Artists like JODI.org, Alexei Shulgin, Vuk Cosic, Olia Lialina and others have demonstrated the creative potential of the web browser.
      <p />
      In recent years, other, newer digital technologies have robbed net art of its popularity, with web technologies evolving tremendously, especially after 2010. Today there is responsive design, CSS3 animation and transitions, rich multimedia elements, and even the ability to create three-dimensional worlds using CSS or WebGL. Web browsers have now evolved into highly complex software platforms that not only display information, but provide a stable foundation for modern software development.

      The goal of this project is to explore the creative-artistic potential of modern web technologies using an exploratory methodology. Based on a few defined conceptual parameters, this should result in a consistent and visually cohesive collection of ideas that can later serve as a foundation for larger projects.
